                <h2>Setting Goals and Objectives</h2>


                <hr class="brief--hr">

                <p>
                    Goals and objectives work on the principle of <a target="_blank" href="https://whatmaster.com/general-and-specific-objectives/"> the general-to-specific method</a>, where the general is
                    the goal and the specific is the objectives.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The brief and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terms_of_reference"> the terms of reference</a> or <a href="https://www.thecloudtutorial.com/technical-specifications/"> technical specifications</a> are often confused. As you go
                    deeper from a company description and general information to detailed requirements, the brief
                    becomes technical specification (terms of reference).
                </p>

                <p>
                    Technical specification or specific tasks are more precise requirements necessary to achieve the goal.
                </p>

                    Depending on whether the project is commercial or nonprofit, goals and objectives have a different
                    nature of creating a product or service.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b> Commercial</b> is a specific or objective set of rules to achieve certain goals, developed by experts
                    over time, these rules are known to most, so there are not many questions.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>Nonprofit</b> projects are mostly based on a subjective idea of the goal. These are often individual
                    preferences. Nonprofit project over time can become successful and monetized. But at the stage of
                    its development are mostly some kind of subjective notions of future success.
                </p>


                <blockquote>

                    <p style="font-weight: 400;">
                        In the creation of creativity for commercial purposes creation of something new and not standard is
                        meant and the value of something new and non-standard is difficult to define if there is nothing to
                        compare it with similar already having value. Creativity often originates as a non-commercial idea
                        and only over time is monetized and capitalized by other market participants.
                    </p>

                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    When you set creative goals and objectives it is worth taking into account what part of it is
                    already objectively established norms when creating such objectives and what part is subjectively a
                    new approach.
                </p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p style="font-weight: 400;">
                        Since it is not always possible to determine everything during the construction of goals and
                        objectives, planning errors are possible. Such mistakes can undermine the trust between the
                        performer and the customer. This often happens when the budget is fixed and the customer is an
                        intermediary.

                    <b> From product to service, there are many different techniques for setting goals and objectives.
                        Agility and waterfall are two different process methods for completing a project or work item.</b>

                <p>
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development" target="_blank"> Agile</a> is an iterative methodology that involves cyclical and collaborative processes. Waterfalls are a
                    sequential method that is also collaborative, but tasks are usually handled in a more linear process.
                    According to agile methodologies, a project goes through a series of cycles throughout the project life
                    cycle. Development phase, reviews, feedback, and release of work items-yes or no. If so, implement it
                    and get the job done. If no, capture the required changes, track and adjust the backlog or priorities to
                    reflect the new knowledge gained, and then proceed to the next task or sprint.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model" target="_blank">Waterfall method </a> is a simpler process that guides the task through the stages of
                    requirement definition, implementation design, work item deployment, implementation and quality
                    assurance review, and finally feature maintenance.

                <h2> Setting Measurable Result</h2>

                <hr class="brief--hr">


                <p>

                    The results are usually measured in relation to the ratio of price, quality and time.
                    In general circles this is called <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_management_triangle"> the triple constraint</a>.
                    In the digital world of the Internet, it is common to measure the number of tasks to be done by the
                    number of files or services, which in turn have a price, quality, and time to complete.
                    It is customary to put each task into a milestone that has the triple constraint. A milestone can
                    include both a fixed price and an hourly rate.
                </p>
                <img class="--image" src="images/pictures/measurable.png" alt="">
                <p>The measurability of tasks and work depends on various factors, including the competence of the customer. While physical work may be easier to measure, creative work poses more challenges in terms of measurement. Therefore, measurement should be approached with caution and careful consideration. The size and complexity of the project also play a role, as smaller and simpler projects are generally easier to measure. In such cases, a project may only have one milestone.</p>

                    All new ideas are mostly created on the basis of old ideas or by mixing them, hence it is rational to
                    find something similar to the existing one before you start creating something new.
                    The more exactly the client's and executor's idea for a new project coincides, the greater the chance
                    that everything will go without a hitch.

But I don’t see information very often about deciding who your target audience is and how to make sure your keyword choices will actually reach them.

                        This is one way to take your keyword research to the next level, and it’s well worth the effort. So rather than trying to guess whether your SEO or PPC ads are appearing in front of the right people, here are some tools you can use to make sure.

                <h2>Creating Project Budget</h2>

                <hr class="brief--hr">

                <p>
                    In the world of project budgeting, there is a variety of payment methods; however, the two main forms are hourly rates and fixed costs. Additionally, customized payment exists, for example, when writing an article, the price may be determined based on the number of characters. The choice of payment method depends on the preferences and convictions of the client or executor.
                </p>


                <img class="--image" src="images/pictures/budget.png" alt="">




                <p>
                    Hourly rate works well when the client doesn't know how long it will take to do a certain type or
                    part
                    of the work. Also, he can't determine how long the changes or revision will take.
                    It is more difficult to control the project budget at this level.
                </p>


                <p>
                    Fixed price payment works when all parts of the project are known or the budget is based on previous
                    similar projects. The changes are either included into the budget or paid additionally.It is easier
                    to
                    control the project budget at this level.

                        Project cost estimating is the process of predicting the total cost of the tasks, time, and resources required to deliver a project's scope of work.

                        Unfortunately for project and resource managers, humans can’t see into the future. And that’s what makes cost estimation for projects a daunting task.

                        But even if you’re not clairvoyant, there are several methods and tools to help you create cost estimates that will be close to the project's actual cost. </p>
