Target marketing focuses on a specific group of consumers with common characteristics such as age, gender, interests, etc. Differentiated marketing involves a combination of both approaches, where a company targets both a broad audience and specific segments.</P>\n\n<P>Considering geography, marketing can be divided into global, export, territorial, and placed-based marketing. Global marketing covers the international market and targets consumers in different countries. Export marketing focuses on selling goods and services beyond the national market. Territorial marketing targets specific geographic zones or regions. Placed-based marketing, or local marketing, emphasizes local communities and markets.</P>\n\n<P>In terms of application, several types of marketing can be distinguished: consumer, industrial, investment, innovation, and service marketing. Consumer marketing targets the end consumer and the sale of goods and services for personal consumption. Industrial marketing is related to the sale of goods and services for use in production processes. Investment marketing aims to attract investments in companies or projects. Innovation marketing involves the introduction of new ideas and technologies to the market. Service marketing encompasses the promotion and sale of various types of services, from financial to consulting.</P>\n\n<P>Thus, these various types of marketing represent a wide range of strategies and tactics that companies can use to achieve their goals in different sectors and markets",

                <br>



                <h2>Types of Marketing</h2>
                <hr class="brief--hr">


                <p>Main types of market coverage in marketing include mass, target, and differentiated approaches.</p>

                <p>Mass marketing targets a broad audience without differentiation, often used when selling mass-produced goods. Target marketing focuses on a specific group of consumers with common characteristics such as age, gender, interests, etc. Differentiated marketing involves a combination of both approaches, where a company targets both a broad audience and specific segments.</p>

                <p>Considering geography, marketing can be divided into global, export, territorial, and placed-based marketing. Global marketing covers the international market and targets consumers in different countries. Export marketing focuses on selling goods and services beyond the national market. Territorial marketing targets specific geographic zones or regions. Placed-based marketing, or local marketing, emphasizes local communities and markets.</p>

                <p>In terms of application, several types of marketing can be distinguished: consumer, industrial, investment, innovation, and service marketing. Consumer marketing targets the end consumer and the sale of goods and services for personal consumption. Industrial marketing is related to the sale of goods and services for use in production processes. Investment marketing aims to attract investments in companies or projects. Innovation marketing involves the introduction of new ideas and technologies to the market. Service marketing encompasses the promotion and sale of various types of services, from financial to consulting.</p>

                <p>Thus, these various types of marketing represent a wide range of strategies and tactics that companies can use to achieve their goals in different sectors and markets.</p>

                <h2>Define the Budget</h2>
                <hr class="brief--hr">
                <p>The budget is an important consideration when planning a marketing project. The following information should be included in the project brief when defining the budget for a marketing project:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Total Budget:</b> This includes the total amount of money allocated for the marketing campaign.</li>
                    <li><b>Budget Allocation:</b> This includes how the total budget will be allocated across different marketing channels or tactics, such as advertising, PR, social media, or events.</li>
                    <li><b>Cost Per Acquisition (CPA):</b> This includes how much it costs to acquire a new customer, which is an important metric to track when evaluating the effectiveness of the marketing campaign.</li>

                    <li><b>Fixed Budget:</b> This is a budget where a fixed amount of money is allocated for the marketing campaign. Once the budget is set, it cannot be changed.</li>
                    <li><b>Flexible Budget:</b> This is a budget where the amount of money allocated for the marketing campaign can be adjusted based on the performance of the campaign.</li>
                    <li><b>Incremental Budget:</b> This is a budget where the marketing budget is increased gradually over time, based on the performance of the campaign.</li>
                    <li><b>Zero-Based Budget:</b> This is a budgeting approach where the marketing budget is started from scratch each year, rather than being based on the previous year's budget. This approach requires a thorough analysis of the marketing needs and objectives of the company to determine the appropriate budget for the upcoming year.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>By considering the budget in detail, marketers can determine the most effective allocation of resources to achieve the campaign goals within the available budget.</p>

                    <li><b>Behavior:</b> This includes information about the target audience's buying behavior, including purchasing frequency, decision-making process, and brand loyalty.</li>
                    <li><b>Pain Points:</b> This includes identifying the pain points or challenges that the target audience faces, and how the product or service being promoted can address these challenges.</li>
                    <li><b>Unique Selling Proposition (USP):</b> This includes identifying the unique selling proposition of the product or service, and how it meets the needs and desires of the target audience.</li>

                        Email marketing is the act of sending a commercial message, typically to a group of people, using email. In its broadest sense, every email sent to a potential or current customer could be considered email marketing. It involves using email to send advertisements, request business, or solicit sales or donations.
