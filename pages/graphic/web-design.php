                <p class=""> <b> Example of how to write brief with essential free and paid tools and basic questions</b> </p>



                <br><br>

                <h2>Overview of Web Design</h2>

                <hr class="brief--hr">
                <p>
                    A website is a useful tool for business, whether you use it to attract customers, make sales, or simply establish your brand. Therefore, it's important for your agency to comprehend how your new website will work with the remainder of your company.
                    <br>
                    Include a summary of your company's history, your products and consumers, your markets, your strengths or shortcomings, and your long-term goals in your website design brief.
                    <br>
                    What position do you have in your industry? Are you the most affordable option, the most expensive option, or anything in between?
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    There are two main options when it comes to website design, one is using free web design templates and the other is designing a website from scratch. Using free web design templates can be a cost-effective option, but it has its limitations in terms of customization, while designing from scratch allows for a more tailored design that aligns with your business and brand, but it can be more expensive. The agency will help you to decide which option is best for your business.
                </p>

                <p>During the <b>discovery phase</b>, the designer should also consider the user experience (UX) and user interface (UI) aspects of the website. This involves identifying the needs, behaviors, and preferences of the target audience and ensuring that the website is designed to meet their needs. The designer may conduct user research, such as surveys, interviews, and usability testing, to gather insights and feedback from potential users.</p>
                <p>In the <b>planning stage</b>, the designer should use the insights gathered during the discovery phase to create a user-centered design (UCD) approach. This approach involves putting the needs and goals of the user at the center of the design process. The designer should create personas, user scenarios, and user stories to help visualize the user's journey through the website and identify potential pain points and opportunities for improvement.</p>
                <p>During the <b>design phase</b>, the designer will create the visual elements of the website, including the layout, color scheme, typography, and imagery. The designer should use the insights gathered during the discovery and planning phases to create a design that is aesthetically pleasing and easy to use. The designer should also consider the user interface (UI) aspects of the website, such as the placement of buttons, menus, and other interactive elements, to ensure that the website is intuitive and easy to navigate.</p>
                <p>The designer should also create low-fidelity wireframes and high-fidelity mockups to help visualize the design and get feedback from the client and potential users. The designer should make revisions based on the feedback received to ensure that the design meets the needs of the user and achieves the project's goals.</p>
                <h3>The Process of Web Design</h3>
                <p>The process of web design typically involves several stages. Here are some common stages of web design:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Discovery:</b> In this stage, the designer works with the client to determine the project's goals, target audience, and overall vision. The designer will ask questions, conduct research, and gather information about the client's business and competitors to inform the design process.</li>
                    <li><b>Planning:</b> Once the designer has a clear understanding of the project's requirements, they will develop a plan outlining the website's structure, layout, and functionality. This may involve creating a site map, wireframes, and user flow diagrams.</li>
                    <li><b>Design:</b> In this stage, the designer will create visual designs for the website, including color schemes, typography, and imagery (<a target="_blank" href="/pages/graphic/graphic.php"> graphic desin</a> , <a target="_blank" href="/pages/graphic/illustration.php"> illustration</a>). The designer will typically create several design concepts to present to the client and will make revisions based on feedback.</li>
                    <li><b>Development:</b> Once the design is approved, the developer will begin building the website using HTML, CSS, and other <a target="_blank" href="/pages/programming/programming.php">programming</a> languages as needed. The developer will also integrate any necessary features or third-party tools, such as <a target="_blank" href="/pages/programming/e-commerce-website.php"> e-commerce platforms </a> or content management systems.</li>
                    <li><b>Testing:</b> In this stage, the website is thoroughly tested to ensure that it functions properly and is user-friendly. This may involve testing for usability, performance, and compatibility with different devices and browsers.</li>
                    <li><b>Launch:</b> Once the website is complete and tested, it can be launched and made live on the internet. The developer will also implement any necessary SEO strategies to ensure that the website is easily discoverable by search engines.</li>
                    <li><b>Maintenance:</b> After the website is launched, it will require ongoing maintenance to ensure that it continues to function properly and meets the client's changing needs. This may involve regular updates, backups, and security checks.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Goals and Objectives </h2>
                <hr class="brief--hr">


                <p>
                    Nowadays, it is anticipated that every business would have some kind of website. But more importantly, why do you require a new one? What goals do you hope to accomplish?
                    <br>
                    Do you want to advertise new goods and services, reach out to new clients, or boost sales and leads specifically? Do you wish to improve the profile of your brand or provide them with a more reliable information source?
                    <br>
                    Or is it more about refining the design, enhancing functionality, enhancing the user experience, or simplifying the site's updating process?
                    <br>
                    Examine your current website objectively, or if you can, ask your visitors. What aspects of it do you like and dislike? What needs to change and what is doing well?

                    What are the new website's overarching goals? We'll typically observe a combination of the following:

                <ul>

                    <li>Amplify brand awareness.</li>
                    <li>Invest in a modern, mobile-responsive website design to boost your online presence.</li>
                    <li>Boost online visibility with both organic and sponsored listings.</li>
                    <li>Enhance sales.</li>
                    <li>Create inquiries and leads.</li>
                    <li>Improved information source via blogs or online education.</li>
                    <li>Bespoke platforms or services are needed to meet the clients' specific needs.</li>




                </ul>




                </p>

                    It is important for web designers to reference existing materials and competitor websites when starting a new project. This allows them to understand the client's needs and preferences more accurately. By researching similar websites and identifying what works well and what doesn't, designers can create a design that stands out and meets the client's needs.

                    <img class="--image" src="/images/pictures/referance.png" alt="">
                    Designers should research their main competitors, take note of their strong and weak points, and identify areas where they can improve and differentiate from them. They should look for inspiration in other websites' layouts, color schemes, typography, photography, and unique features. By carefully studying these references, designers can create a design that is both visually appealing and functional for the target audience. Additionally, by aligning the design with the client's expectations and needs, there is a higher chance of the project being successful.

                <h2>Budget</h2>

                <hr class="brief--hr">
                <p>
                    It is important for individuals or businesses to conduct early budget planning in order to control spending and guide decision-making throughout a project. Utilizing tools such as Google Sheets or other budgeting tools can help create a detailed budget plan that includes specific numbers and expenses. Conducting research on industry standard hourly rates or fixed prices for similar projects can be done using Google Search or other online resources. Additionally, utilizing Google Ads can help find cost-effective solutions for marketing and advertising expenses. By giving ample time to work on the budget before beginning the project, a well-organized plan can be presented to the relevant authorities and stakeholders, which will be greatly appreciated. Furthermore, it is also important for freelancers to establish their own hourly rate and fixed price for the project, considering their experience, skill level, and the industry standards.

                </p>
                <p>There are several ways to approach budgeting for a web design project. Here are some common methods:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Fixed Price:</b> This is a common approach where the designer sets a fixed price for the entire project. The price is determined based on the estimated time and resources needed to complete the project. This approach provides the client with a clear understanding of the project cost upfront and ensures that the designer is paid a fair price for their work.</li>
                    <li><b>Hourly Rate:</b> This approach involves charging the client an hourly rate for the time spent on the project. The hourly rate can vary depending on the designer's level of experience and the complexity of the project. This approach is more flexible and allows for changes to the project scope without affecting the overall cost.</li>
                    <li><b>Value-Based Pricing:</b> This approach involves determining the value that the website will bring to the client's business and charging a price based on that value. This approach requires a deeper understanding of the client's business and the role the website will play in achieving their goals.</li>
                    <li><b>Cost-Plus Pricing:</b> This approach involves determining the total cost of the project, including materials and labor, and adding a percentage markup to cover the designer's profit. This approach ensures that the designer is compensated for all expenses incurred during the project.</li>
                    <li><b>Package Pricing:</b> This approach involves offering pre-set packages that include specific features and services at a fixed price. This approach simplifies the pricing process for the client and makes it easier for the designer to manage their workload.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Ultimately, the chosen approach to budgeting will depend on the project's unique needs, the designer's experience, and the client's budget and expectations.</p>

                    Will you be updating the website's content? If so, it would be a good idea to sketch up a preliminary sitemap in your brief at this stage. How many pages overall will there be?

                    Be specific about the team members and the approval procedure for this content. Start thinking about this from day one because the availability of material is frequently a problem that causes website launches to be delayed.

                        It’s pretty simple. Any marketing, whether it be video marketing or otherwise, we’ll miss the mark if you have no idea who you’re trying to reach with your message. So, the critical first step when you’re getting started with video marketing for your business is to clearly identify your target audience, and that’s what I’ll be helping you do in this article.

                    <p>
                        A common mistake made by creators is to assume that their target audience will come effortlessly over their brand’s YouTube channel, if you just focus on creating and publishing more videos. Although a study suggests that 78% of people watch online videos every week, only a tiny fraction might be interested in what you sell.
