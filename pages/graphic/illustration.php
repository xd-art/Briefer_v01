                <h1>How to Make Illustration Project: Example of Project Brief with Essential Free and Paid Tools. </h1>






                <br><br>

                <h2>Overview</h2>

                <hr class="brief--hr">

                <p>

                    Commercial illustrations are used to sell products or promote a brand, while nonprofit illustrations are used to raise awareness and educate the public about a cause. Both types of illustrations are important for communicating information and influencing public opinion, but have different goals. Commercial illustrations aim to persuade people to buy something, while nonprofit illustrations aim to inform and educate. Both types of illustrations require the ability to create visually appealing images that effectively convey a message.

                    <br><br>
                    Before starting to design any illustration, an illustrator should have a clear understanding of the following information from the customer:

                <ul>

                    <li>The purpose of the illustration: What message or idea is the illustration meant to convey? How will it be used (e.g. print, digital, packaging)? </li>

                    <li>The target audience: Who is the illustration intended for? What are their demographics, interests, and preferences? </li>

                    <li>The style and tone of the illustration: What type of illustration is the customer looking for? (e.g. vector, raster, hand-drawn, 3D, etc.) What is the desired mood or tone of the illustration (e.g. serious, playful, whimsical, etc.) </li>

                    <li>The design direction: Does the customer have any specific design elements or concepts in mind? Are there any examples of existing illustrations that they like or dislike? </li>

                    <li>The color scheme and composition: what are the main colors that the customer wants the illustration to have, and how the composition should be. </li>

                    <li>The format and size: what format and size the illustration should be. </li>

                    <li>The deadline: When does the customer need the illustration completed? Are there any specific milestones that need to be met along the way? </li>

                    <li>The usage rights: How will the illustration be used, and for how long, who will own the rights of the illustration, and what are the terms of the contract. </li>

                    <li>The budget: What is the budget for the illustration and what are the terms of payment. </li>

                </ul>


                This information helps the illustrator create an illustration that meets the customer's needs and expectations. <br><br>


                <h3> There are many types of illustrations that can be found on the internet, including:</h3>

                <ol>
                    <li> Vector illustrations - created using software such as Adobe Illustrator, these illustrations use mathematical equations to create scalable graphics.</li>

                    <li>Raster illustrations - created using software such as Adobe Photoshop, these illustrations use pixels to create images.</li>

                    <li>Hand-drawn illustrations - created using traditional mediums such as pencils and paint, these illustrations can be scanned and uploaded to the internet.</li>

                    <li>3D illustrations - created using software such as Autodesk Maya or Blender, these illustrations use mathematical models to create three-dimensional graphics.</li>
                </ol>

                        Trust is the social glue that holds business relationships together. But, how do managers decide whether to trust a potential partner outside their business? And how does culture influence this decision-making process? To answer these questions, the authors... </p>

                <h2>Goals and Objectives </h2>
                <hr class="brief--hr">

                <p>Graphic designers utilize illustration, a powerful tool, to communicate ideas and messages. Illustrations can be created using various techniques such as drawing, painting, or digital media. They find applications in diverse design projects such as posters, book covers,<a href="/pages/graphic/infographic.php" target="_blank"> infographics </a> , and <a href="/pages/marketing/marketing.php" target="_blank"> advertisements </a> .</p>

                <p>In the context of graphic design, an illustration serves as a visual representation of an idea or concept. It can be employed to create visual metaphors, explain abstract concepts, or inject humor into a design.</p>

                <p>When creating an illustration, it's crucial to consider the target audience and the message that needs to be conveyed. The style, color, and composition of the illustration should be chosen carefully to ensure resonance with the audience and effective communication of the intended message.</p>

                <p>The objectives and goals of an illustration depend on the context in which it is used. For example, in web design and video design:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><a href="/pages/graphic/web-design.php" target="_blank">Web Design:</a> Illustrations in web design may focus on enhancing the visual appeal of a website, making it more engaging for visitors.</li>
                    <li><a href="/pages/video/video.php" target="_blank">Video Design:</a> In video design, illustrations, including storyboards and character design, play a crucial role in storytelling by adding visual interest and complementing the overall narrative.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Specifically, the objectives of an illustration are to:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Communicate: Illustrations help to communicate complex ideas and messages in a simple and engaging way.</li>
                    <li>Engage: Illustrations can capture the attention of the audience and make the content more interesting and memorable.</li>
                    <li>Clarify: Illustrations can help to clarify complex concepts and ideas by providing visual representations.</li>
                </ul>





                <!-- <p>
                    Do you have any specific elements in mind for your illustration? If you aren't clear here, the illustrator will be able to interpret the brief however they see fit, which may not be what you had in mind for the final output. In this case, my element description read as follows: "The book must have a strong African and South African focus and speak to both oral and written story-telling traditions. Additionally, it needs to include various media formats like books and tablets. Reading ought to be portrayed as a social activity."
                    <br>
                    You often don't get the dimensions from people. Include here any text that has to be on the illustration, any bleed requirements for printing, and whether or not the illustration will be printed in CMYK (best printing) or RGB (best for computer display). For the aforementioned example, my memo stated: "The book is 170 x 245 in size. Portrait. The title, subtitle, and author names often need to be placed within a third of the front cover. To contain all of these components, the graphic designer might need to crop or otherwise alter the cover image. The graphic designer and the publishing house will decide this at their discretion. Format: CMYK ink will be used to print the cover."


                </p> -->

                <h2>Measurable Result</h2>
                <hr class="brief--hr">

                <p>

                    When writing a creative brief for an illustration project, it is important to establish measurable results that align with the project's triple constraint of scope, time, and cost. These results should be specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART).



                </p>

                <h3> Examples of measurable results for an illustration project include:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li> Increasing website traffic by x% within a certain period of time through the use of the illustration on the website, while adhering to the budget and project deadline</li>
                    <li> Achieving a certain number of social media shares or engagement within a specific period of time through the use of the illustration on social media, while meeting the project's scope and budget</li>
                    <li> Improving brand awareness by x% as measured by a survey before and after the introduction of the illustration, within the time frame and budget of the project</li>
                    <li> Increasing sales by x% within a certain period of time through the use of the illustration on packaging or in advertising, while staying within the project's scope, time and budget constraints</li>
                    <li> Improving customer satisfaction as measured by a survey before and after the introduction of the illustration, while adhering to the project's scope, time and budget limits</li>
                </ul>
                <p>

                    By including measurable results in the creative brief that align with the project's triple constraint of scope, time, and cost, the illustrator and the customer can have a clear understanding of the goals and objectives of the illustration project, and the success of the illustration can be evaluated based on these results.

                </p>

                        Whether you’re a one-person freelance company or have a team that you work with, goals are imperative in terms of providing direction for your company.

                        Goals can be around revenue growth, customer satisfaction, or just about anything associated with improving your business long-term. Once set, you need to establish measurable objectives supporting them. The article How to Set Goals does a great job of explaining goals and what criteria should be used when setting supporting objectives. </p>

                <p>
                    When crafting a creative brief for an illustration project, it's essential to provide references for the illustrator to use as inspiration and guidance. These references can include examples of existing illustrations, artwork, or visual styles that align with the desired look and feel of the project. Providing references allows the illustrator to gain a deeper understanding of the customer's vision and expectations for the project, and can help to ensure that the final product meets those expectations.


                    <img class="--image" src="/images/pictures/referance.png" alt="">
                    It's also important to note that all new ideas are often built on the foundation of existing ones, or by combining and modifying existing concepts. By providing references, the illustrator can better understand the customer's desired direction and create an illustration that aligns with that vision.
                    <br><br>
                    The closer the customer's and illustrator's ideas for the project match, the greater the chance that the project will be completed successfully. By providing clear and relevant references in the creative brief, the customer can help the illustrator to understand their vision and create an illustration that exceeds expectations.

                <p>
                    Setting up a budget early on will help you truly manage your money and direct your decision-making. Make sure to record precise figures and, when possible, include expenditures. It will be beneficial to conduct some brief research beforehand. Are there any strategies to reduce your expenses? You'll keep your boss happy if you allow yourself some time to fiddle with the figures before you even start the work!
                    <br>

                <h3> There are two main ways to form a budget for an illustration project: using a fixed price or an hourly rate.</h3>

                <b>Fixed Price:</b> In this method, the customer and illustrator agree on a set price for the entire project before work begins. This method works best when the scope of the project is well-defined and the customer has a clear idea of what they want the illustration to look like. A fixed price budget can be beneficial for the customer as it allows them to have a clear understanding of the total cost of the project, and the illustrator can plan their workload and resources accordingly.
                <br>
                <b> Hourly Rate:</b> In this method, the customer and illustrator agree on an hourly rate for the illustrator's services. The total cost of the project is determined by the number of hours worked on the project. This method works best when the scope of the project is not well-defined or when the customer wants to leave room for revisions and changes. An hourly rate budget can be beneficial for the illustrator as it allows them to charge for any additional hours they may spend on the project.
                <br><br>
                It's important to note that both methods have their pros and cons, and the choice of which one to use will depend on the specific project and the needs and preferences of the customer and the illustrator. It's also important to have a clear communication and agreement on the terms of the budget before the project starts.

                        I studied graphic design at the University of Pretoria and later completed my Master’s degree in illustration at the University of Stellenbosch. I am currently based in Cape Town where I work as a freelance illustrator and graphic facilitator.

                        <br>
                        I showcase my corporate and business illustrations on my www.fine-line.co.za website. My personal website (www.nicolenelouw.co.za) is dedicated to my editorial and more traditional illustration work.
